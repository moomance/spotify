# SPOTIFY 24 hours hackathon
The challenge posed by Spotify during the 24-hour hackathon was centered around podcasters and finding innovative ways to facilitate meaningful interactions with their audience. The goal was to create an intuitive, rewarding, and fun platform that connects podcasters and their listeners, focusing on catering to Gen Z users.



# The solution
Utilize machine learning, specifically Auto Speech Recognition, to generate compelling clips of podcast episodes. We then create an interactive feed on the platform where listeners can engage with these snippets, leave comments, like, dislike, and share their favorite clips.
The platform's machine-learning capabilities enable it to learn from user interactions and preferences. 
Over time, the feed becomes more personalized, presenting listeners with snippets that align with their specific interests and tastes.This approach makes sharing podcasts as fun, easy, and rewarding as sharing music, while taking advantage of Spotify for Podcasters' resources.




## My contributions
As a Software Engineer, I played a key role in swiftly building the solution while adhering to pixel-perfect designs and features crafted by the UX designers. Utilizing my background in UX design, I assisted the UX design team in creating an intuitive platform, ensuring ease of use and optimal interaction.
Through effective communication and collaboration, I facilitated a cohesive approach between the Software Engineering, Data Science and UX Design teams, resulting in a successful and rewarding product that connects podcasters with their audience which led us to winning the competition.

### Lessons learned and next steps

#### What we did well

The team demonstrated great communication skills, fostering an environment where each member felt comfortable sharing their struggles and seeking help when needed.

This open and collaborative communication played a significant role in saving time and streamlining the overall process. We clearly articulated their requirements and needs, ensuring that everyone was on the same page. This effective collaboration allowed for the successful delivery of pixel-perfect solutions within the given timeframe, ultimately contributing to winning the competition.

#### What we would do differently

While the team's communication was exceptional, some aspects of time management could be improved. For example, I spent time on trying to implement auto subtitles using an API which resulted in delays on the software engineering part.

The experience of spending significant time on implementing auto subtitles highlights the value of learning from such situations. Taking the lessons learned into account for future projects will enable me to be even more proactive and prepared to tackle similar challenges swiftly and effectively.
